<h1 id="about-me"></h1>

<h2 style="margin: 60px 0px 10px;">Short Bio</h2>

I am currently a fourth-year Ph.D. student in the [Spoken Language Systems (LSV)](https://www.lsv.uni-saarland.de/) group at
[Saarland University](https://www.uni-saarland.de/en/home.html),
under the supervision of [Prof. Dietrich Klakow](https://scholar.google.de/citations?user=_HtGYmoAAAAJ).
I am also a member of the [Saarbrücken Graduate School of Computer Science](https://www.graduateschool-computerscience.de/) 
and the [SFB 1102-Information Density and Linguistic Encoding (IDeaL)](https://sfb1102.uni-saarland.de/) project.
My research interests lie in the general area of natural language processing (NLP), particularly in **representation analysis**, **multilingual modeling**, and **robust NLP**.

Previously, I obtained my Bachelor’s degree from [Harbin Engineering University](https://english.hrbeu.edu.cn/index.htm) in 2014 and my Master’s degree from 
[Chinese Academy of Sciences](https://english.cas.cn/) in 2017. 
Between 2017 and 2018, I worked as a Research & Development Engineer at Baidu Inc, and as an Algorithm Engineer at a startup. 
In 2019, I completed a research immersion lab at [MPI-INF](https://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/home) under the supervision of 
[Prof. Bernt Schiele](https://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/departments/computer-vision-and-machine-learning/people/bernt-schiele) 
and [Dr. Yongqin Xian](https://xianyongqin.github.io/).

In my free time, I enjoy swimming, reading, music, gaming, and exploring new things.
